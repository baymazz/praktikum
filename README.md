it just my assignment.

i already made it but it all gone.

because when i install Artix Linux, i put /dev/sda instead of /dev/sdb
and i didn't make any backup before.

so i learn github and make repository for it and i need to do it all over again. :grinning:

## for yall who gets the same assignments, feel free to "git clone" my repo!
work in progress tho, even better if you help me
